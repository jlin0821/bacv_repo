        Hopefully this file will help you avoid being ticketed. The methods
  I am going to discuss in achieving successful speeding are going to deal
  mainly with highways. I hope this file helps.
        Ok. So you like to speed? Being that I live in NJ I know that I do.
  One of the things that I learned is that the only place where you should 
  speed is on a highway. Why? Because it is the easiest place to detect cops!
  I have never been pulled over on a highway but I have been pulled over 11
  times on local roads. I have learned by now that speeding on local roads is 
  stupid for the following reasons:

        1.) There is no way you can always detect a cop off of a highway.

        2.) If you are pulled over on a local road you are more likely to 
            get a ticket because most people don't ever go above 50 and you
            will not have been going the speed of traffic. You will have to
            find a very good bullshit excuse to get off.

        3.) It is easier to get into accidents on local roads.

        Try to avoid speeding on local roads! However, it is very easy on 
  highways. First if you are going to speed on the highway then you should
  have a radar detector. They help BUT DO NOT RELY ON THEM! Many cops on
  the highways use Pulse or Instant On radar guns and your radar detector will
  not go off until you have already been clocked. However, they are nice
  because if you are a ways back from a cop on a highway using instant on 
  your light on the radar detector may go on briefly and no sound may occur.
  If the light goes off with no sound YOU CAN BET that there is a cop using
  Instant On or Pulse Radar ahead and you should slow down. Because the best
  way of detecting the cop is with this method the Passport Radar Detector
  is one of the best because its field can stretch for 3 miles. However, 
  Radar detectors should not be solely relied upon. The cars around you and
  other marks are the best, but added with a radar detector you should be
  able to avoid cops completely.
        One of the surest things I've found to avoid cops are trucks. Truckers
  use their CB's to communicate with each other and warn each other about
  cops. If you see a truck apllying its breaks or actually DOING the speed
  limit then you should slow down. They are the first people to know about 
  cops. Trucks are also good to speed along side of (in the right hand lane
  if possible) because they are much larger than you. If the truck is in front
  of you or to the left of you it is more likely that they will get clocked
  and believe it or not cops like to pull over trucks more than cars.
        Another thing you should keep your eyes peeled for are long white
  lines painted across the highway. They look like finish lines across the
  road. They are a sure sign of a speed trap and if a cop is sitting in the
  trap he may not be using radar. You will run across 2 of these lines before
  you reach the place where the cop actually sits. The cop might not be using
  radar because he doesn't need it to clock you because of the lines. The
  lines are used to time you! When you crosss over the first line the cop will
  start a timing device and stop it when you cross the second. He will know
  the time it takes to travel the distance between the two lines if you are
  going the speed limit and will be able to calculate how fast you were going 
  by the time it took for you to travel them. This method IS acceptable in a 
  court of law so if you see these white lines (or any lines that are painted
  acrosss the road) SLOW DOWN!
        Another good thing to do is slow down when you are going around a 
  curve on a highway where you can't see all of the road in front of you. 
  Cops normally sit in places after these curves and you will get clocked.
        Also, on the parts of the highway where you can see traffic a ways 
  ahead of you you should watch the cars that are furthest away from you
  but in your visible range. If you see a couple of cars brake lights go on
  then continue to watch the area where their brake lights went on for other
  cars brake lights to go on. If you see other brake lights going on in that
  same area then it is most likely that a cop has set a speed trap there and 
  people are slowing down when they see him. Remember that unless you are 
  driving in heavy traffic most cars will not apply their brakes on a highway
  unless there has been an accident or a cop is present. Brake lights are 
  always a good sign to slow down to the speed limit.
        Also, when speeding you should try to avoid the fast lane. That's
  right! You should do most of your speeding in the far right lane otherwise
  known as the granny lane. Here is why. Most cops set their speed traps
  in the median of the highway. They do this so that they can clock people 
  in the fast lane the easiest! If you are speeding in the fast lane then
  it is more likely for you to get clocked! Now it is still possible for you
  to get clocked in the slow lane but an interesting error can occur if you
  are. The reading on the cops radar gun will not be accurate! In order for
  the radar gun to clock the exact speed you were going it must be pointed 
  directly at you. But if you are travelling in the slow lane it is more 
  likely that you will be at an angle to the radar gun. The more of an angle
  you are away from the radar gun the greater the error. The error which
  occurs is that the reading on the cops radar gun will be slower than
  you were actually going and will potentially save you from getting a
  heftier ticket.
        Finally, I know that plenty of you have either read about or heard 
  about Radar Jammers. Radar Jammers are very stupid to use and a big waste
  of money. IT IS ILLEGAL TO JAM RADAR IN THE UNITED STATES! Radar Jammers
  are also very easilly detectable by cops. When you use a radar jammer, the
  speed which registers on the radar gun will range from 300-500 some miles
  per hour. Now considering most cars can't even go 140 a cop will know
  something is up when it says a car was travelling 300 miles per hour.
  Don't buy a Radar Jammer! It isn't worth it. As long as you are aware
  on the highways and keep your eyes peeled for signs of police then it is
  most likely that you will never be pulled over. I hope you enjoyed 
  the file.

  Final Note: The BëM Squad is still very interested in gaining new writers
              and distro sites. If you are interested please fill out the
              BOM.APP file and send it up to The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test 
              if possible or any of the other sites and leave me E-mail. 
              Thanks.
